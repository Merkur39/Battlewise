"""A creature's attacks: the weapon items its Humanoid is given (GiveDefaultItems), kept when
ItemData.IsWeapon and aimed at enemies (EquipBestWeapon), followed through every prefab they spawn as
the 1.0.20 code does.

- Attack.OnAttackTrigger: melee and area attacks hit with the item damage x m_damageMultiplier and spawn
  m_spawnOnTrigger; melee also spawns m_shared.m_spawnOnHit once anything is hit (DoMeleeAttack);
  Attack.m_spawnOnHit goes off on a chance per target, and replaces a fired projectile's own. A
  projectile attack fires m_projectiles per burst, m_projectileBursts bursts m_burstInterval apart
  (FireProjectileBurst), each set up with the attack hit. The EffectLists the attack creates are
  instantiated, never set up (EffectList.Create).
- IProjectile.Setup: a Projectile takes the attack hit over its own damage, an Aoe only with
  m_useAttackSettings; both hit with staggerMultiplier 1 (Projectile.OnHit, Aoe.OnHit). Projectile.SpawnOnHit
  passes the hit on only with m_projectilesInheritHitData. SpawnAbility ignores it: it spawns
  Random.Range(min, max) prefabs (max excluded) and only sets up a root Projectile, with the creature as
  owner; the characters it spawns are summons, capped by m_maxSpawned. Other abilities deal no damage.
- Scaling (Attack.ModifyDamage, Character.RPC_Damage): "attack" for a hit the attack built (stars and
  world), "world" for own damage with the creature as owner, "none" without owner (an Aoe spawned by
  SpawnAbility or by an EffectList). Generic damage is "trueDamage" (blocks, armour and resistances
  ignore it).
- An Aoe hits the same target every m_hitInterval during m_ttl once active (Aoe.CustomFixedUpdate,
  Aoe.Update). Without triggers "max" is exact. With triggers it hits on contact, then again each time
  Update clears its hit list, the first time at once: "max" is one more than ttl over the interval, an
  upper bound frame timing can lower by one or two. A Projectile with m_hitMidFlight
  hits every m_flightHitInterval while it flies.
- Character.OnDeath creates m_deathEffects ("onDeath", and "deathSummons" for the creatures they bring),
  then CharacterDrop drops what it holds, a creature prefab alive: Random.Range(min, max) of it (max
  excluded), its chance and amount doubled per star with m_levelMultiplier ("doublesPerStar"). An attack
  that kills its user includes the death hits and says so ("killsSelf").
- Timers that run on fixed steps (Time.fixedDeltaTime, the TimeManager's) fire on the step that takes
  them past their interval, in float32: projectile bursts (Attack.UpdateProjectile), Aoe ticks without
  triggers (Aoe.CustomFixedUpdate), mid-flight hits (Projectile.FixedUpdate). Aoe ticks with triggers
  run per frame (Aoe.Update) and keep their interval.
- A projectile's m_hitEffects are created wherever it hits (Projectile.OnHit): an EffectArea among them
  with a status effect is a pool that gives it to the players standing in it, while its TimedDestruction
  lasts ("leaves").
- Projectile.OnHit only spawns m_spawnOnHit where its flags allow: on a character unless
  m_spawnOnCharacters is off, and SpawnOnHit only on the ground with m_groundHitOnly, only on static
  objects with m_staticHitOnly. What cannot spawn on a direct hit comes "afterMiss".
- A spawned ImpactEffect (a thrown log) hits what it runs into with its own damage, times
  LerpStep(m_minVelocity, m_maxVelocity, speed): listed at full speed, with no attacker (HitData defaults:
  neither blockable nor dodgeable) and no scaling.
- MonsterAI only attacks when BaseAI.IsLookingAt holds: an angle below m_aiAttackMaxAngle, inverted by
  m_aiInvertAngleCheck. An attack whose check can never pass is left out.
- TriggerSpawnAbility wakes every TriggerSpawner in range (TriggerAllInRange); the game places them only
  in the Seeker Queen's room, so all placed ones count. Each spawns one of its creatures while fewer than
  m_maxSpawned of it are around (m_maxExtraPerPlayer adds some with more players).
- MovementDamage switches its m_runDamageObject on while the creature runs faster than m_speedTreshold:
  an Aoe it set up as owner, with its own damage ("trample").

Damage is listed at its maximum. The game multiplies an attack's hit by Character.GetRandomSkillFactor,
sqrt(Random.Range(0.75, 1)) for a creature (0.866 to 1); a melee swing with m_multiHit and
m_lowerDamagePerHit that registers several objects (the ground among them with m_hitTerrain) divides it
by 0.75 times their number. Left out: the fires the cinders of a meteor or a fireball may light
(CinderSpawner, only in the Ashlands or with the Fire world key), the environment rather than the attack.
